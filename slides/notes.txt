 2: Puff of steem published, LN just submitted
 4: posting & voting touches blockchain
 5: coins fixed for us
    + some system parameters
 8: ideal: ordered by sum of likabilities
 9: honest players, adversarial input
    collusions mutually beneficial
10: best case numbers for Ethereum
11: doesn't really scale
12: only interested parties involved
    if one cheats, counterparty proves on-chain
15: Only insecurity sources are digital signatures
    Also prove 2 ad-hoc constructions secure, one with a new primitive
16: Cryptography not enough
    Throwing more cryptography at the problem, pushing it farther away
    Too interdisciplinary
17: Ordered roughly by probability of completion
    6 months to complete first two
    No promises to do all of them
